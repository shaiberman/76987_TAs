%% part 1 :  Basic MR concepts

%% 
% In this tutorial, principles are illustrated for signals derived from a
% bulk substance, such as a beaker of water. Various terms used to describe
% the MR principles, including spins, parallel and anti-parallel, Boltzman
% distribution are introduced.

%% Spin velocity - Question 1
% When a substance with net spin is placed in a steady magnetic field, it
% precesses at a frequency that is characteristic of that substance. We saw
% in class the simple formula for the computation of the precession
% frequency (see chapter 3 and ca. p. 51i, 60ii for a discussion of
% precession).

%1.1.
% Compute the Larmor frequency of Hydrogen in a 1.5T magnetic field, given
% that the gyromagnetic ratio of hydrogen is the following: 
B0 = 1.5;     % Magnetic field strength (Tesla)
gH = 42.58e+6; % Gyromagnetic constant for hydrogen (Hz / Tesla)
vH=[];
fprintf('The resonant frequency of spins in hydrogen is %0.4f (MHz) at %.2f Tesla \n',vH/(10^6),B0);

%1.2.
% Compute the Larmor frequency of Sodium in a 3T magnetic field, given
% that the gyromagnetic ratio of Sodium is the following: 
B0=3; 
gNa=11.27e+6;
vNa=[];
fprintf('The resonant frequency of spins in sodium is %0.4f (MHz) at %.2f Tesla \n',vNa/(10^6),B0);

%% Spin Energy 
%
% At steady state, say when the subject enters the magnet and prior to any
% measurements, the dipoles align parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic
% field. The physical separation of spin-up (parallel) and spin-down
% (anti-parallel) particles, reflects an energy difference between the
% two states (Zeeman effect, http://mri-q.com/energy-splitting.html)
%
% The energy difference between these two states of a precesing spin is
% proportional to its resonant frequency (and therfore to the magnetic
% field). The constant of proportionality between energy and frequency is
% called Planck's constant. The energy differnce is called the transition
% energy, as it is the energy required for causing the spin to transition
% from parallel to anti-parallel (and the energy that is emitted when the
% spin transitions from anti-parallel to parallel). This also teaches us
% that the parallel state is the low-energy state and the anti-parallel is
% the high-energy state. 

h = 6.626e-34; % Planck's constant (J s)
dE = h * vH; %   Transition energy
% and also: dE = h * gH * B0;

%% Question 2
% Describe what we see in the graph

%% Bulk magnetization  

% we measure the sum magnetization of many dipoles. Therefore, it is
% important to have an unequal number of dipoles in each state, otherwise,
% the net magnetiztion would be zero. The proportion of dipoles aligned
% parallel (low energy) (high energy) to the main field is described by the
% Boltzmann distribution.

k = 1.3805e-23;      % Boltzmann's constant, J/Kelvin
T = 300;             % Degrees Kelvin at room temperature
ratioHigh2Low = exp(-dE/(k*T));  % Boltzmann's formula, Hornak, Chapter 3; Huettel, p. 76ii

% Under typical conditions the number of dipoles in the low and high energy
% states are very similar:
fprintf('Ratio of the probabilities of the dipoles to be in the high vs. low energy state:  %e \n',ratioHigh2Low)

%% Question 3
% 3.1
% At low temperatures (near absolute zero), very few of the dipoles enter
% the high (anti-parallel) energy state. How does that affect the signal?
% 3.2
% How does the transition energy affect the signal.

%4.1
% Where is human body temperature on the graph?  Given human body
% temperature, what is the ratio of p(high)/p(low energy)? what would happen if
% we kept the room cooler?
% 4.2

%% part 2: T1 and T2 relaxation times


%% T1 tissue contrast
%
% The tendency of dipoles to align (either parallel or anti-parallel) with
% the B0 magnetic field imposes an opportunity to probe tissue properties
% using magnetic resonance. MR signals are derived by perturbing the
% ordered spins (excitation) and then measuring the emissions (reception)
% as the dipoles return to their low energy state. The way the dipoles
% return to their low energy state provides information about the local
% tissue.
%
% Summing the effect of the many many dipoles within a voxel, we obtain a
% measure of the dipoles within the voxel called the net magnetization.
% This is represented by a single vector (see the many examples in Hornak).
% Most reasoning about the MR signal is based on understanding models of
% the net magnetization vector and how it recovers after being perturbed by
% the radio frequency pulses in the presence of changing magnetic fields.
%
mrvNewGraphWin('Z-magnetization');

% The MR measurements that we obtain describe the net magnetization in the
% direction perpendicular to the main axis (B0 field). This direction is
% illustrated in the following figures.

% in the steady-state.  The blue lines show the three axes.

%% T2 contrast

%
% There is a second physical mechanism, in addition to the spin-lattice
% measurement, that influences the MR signal. This second mechanism is
% called spin-spin interaction (transverse relaxation). This signaling
% mechanism is particularly important for functional magnetic resonance
% imaging and the BOLD signal.
%
% In describing the T1 signal, we treated the MR signal as a single unified
% vector. In the example above, we explored what happens to the net
% magnetization of the MR signal when the vector is rotated 90 deg into the
% x-y plane.
%
% But we omitted any discussion of the fact that the dipoles are assumed to be
% continuously precessing around the main axis together, in unison. Perhaps
% in a perfectly homogeneous environment, these rotating dipoles would
% precess at the Larmor frequency in perfect synchronization and we could
% treat the single large vector as we have.
%
% But in practice, the  dipoles within a single voxel of a functional image
% each experience slightly different magnetic environments. Consequently,
% they each have their own individual Larmor frequencies, proportional to
% the magnetic field that they experience. An important second mechanism of
% MR is a consequence of the fact that the individual dipoles each have
% their own local magnetic field and the synchrony soon dissipats.
%% right after excitation: angle distribution
% Suppose  we have a large sample of dipoles that are spinning together in
